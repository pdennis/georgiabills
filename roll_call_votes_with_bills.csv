Roll Call 19,"HB 487 proposes to amend Georgia's sales tax exemption for electricity used in irrigation, expanding it to include other fuels.

By Representatives Roberts of the 154th, McCall of the 30th, Floyd of the 147th, Royal of the 171st, Ray of the 136th and others: A BILL to be entitled an Act to amend Code Section 48-8-3 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to exemptions from state sales and use tax, so as to change the exemption regarding electricity sales for irrigation of farm crops; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes. Senate Sponsor: Senator Cagle of the 49th. The following Fiscal Note, as required by law, was read by the Secretary: DEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS 254 Washington Street, S.W., Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400 Russell W. Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 14, 2005 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 487 (LC 18 4102) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill would change the sales tax exemption on the sale of electricity for operation of irrigation systems used on farm crops. The exemption would be broadened to refer to “electricity or other fuel”. The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center indicates that the exemption of these fuel expenditures from the sales tax would reduce Georgia tax revenue by $204,000 50 1990 per year. The Center indicated that based on the latest data available, fuel expenses for on-farm pumping of irrigation water in the State of Georgia totaled $10,905,000 in 2003. Of this total, expenditures on fuels other than electricity equaled $5,100,000. This data was reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002 Census of Agriculture, 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey. This estimate was calculated by multiplying the 4% state sales tax rate times $5,100,000, the additional expenditures on fuels that would be exempt under the proposed legislation. The long range impact of this proposed legislation is expected to remain in the range of this estimate. Energy consumption for irrigation is not projected to increase substantially over time. While prices for petroleum products increased substantially in late 2004, they are likely to moderate somewhat over the near term and then, on average, rise gradually. Sincerely, /s/ Russell W.

Roll Call 20,"HB 389 seeks to amend Georgia's job tax credit program by introducing an additional tax credit of $500 for each new full-time job created by certain existing businesses that have operated in the state for at least three years. This credit would be applicable for newly created jobs starting from January 1, 2006, until the end of the tax year starting prior to January 1, 2011, and would result in an estimated revenue loss of $21.2 million over five tax years.",potential hot button issue,"HB 389.

Senate Sponsor: Senator Cagle of the 49th. The following Fiscal Note, as required by law, was read by the Secretary: DEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS 254 Washington Street, S.W., Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400 Russell W. Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 14, 2005 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2005 1993 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 389 (LC 18 4111-EC) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill modifies the existing job tax credit program. The bill provides for an additional state income tax credit for certain businesses that have operated within the state for the immediately preceding three years. These businesses would be allowed, under certain conditions, a one year tax credit of $500 for each new full-time employee job. The credit would be claimed in year two after the job was created and would apply only to new jobs created in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and ending no later than taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2011. The additional tax credit cannot be carried forward. Eligible industries and the required minimum number of jobs created are the same as for the current job tax credit. The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center indicates that for the five tax years 2007 through 2011, the total estimated revenue loss is $21.2 million, or $4.24 million per year. This assumes that the additional credit is allowed for only one year. The modification to paragraph (e)(2) in Section 1 of the bill states that the additional credit is allowed for one year after the creation of the job. This paragraph also states that the credit shall not be allowed during a year if the employment increase falls below the required number of new jobs. This seems to imply that the credit can be taken for more than one year. The Center provided the following narrative regarding the calculation of their revenue estimate: Using employment security records, an estimate of the number of jobs that would have been eligible for each year 1996 through 2004 was determined. To be eligible, a firm had to be in an eligible industry, had to be in existence for three years, and had to have created the minimum number of jobs. Employment growth over the past four years has been low. To be more reflective of future job growth, the estimated number of jobs determined to have been eligible for the period 1996 through 2000 was used for the revenue estimation. Experience with the job tax credit program suggests that not all firms that appear to be eligible take the job tax credit. The most recent estimate of the participation rate is 30 percent. Multiplying the number of eligible jobs by $500 times the participation rate yields the revenue estimate. Table 1 presents the annual estimated revenue loss. For the five tax years, 2007 through 2011, the total estimated revenue loss is $21.2 million, or $4.24 million per year. 52 1994 Table 1. Annual Estimated Revenue Loss Year Revenue Loss (in millions) 2007 $ 3.8 2008 $ 4.2 2009 $ 4.4 2010 $ 4.8 2011 $ 4.0 Total $21.2 Note that if the credit can be taken for five years, then the estimated revenue loss for the next five years would be as seen in Table 2.

Roll Call 22,"House Bill 404 amends Georgia's unemployment benefit laws to ensure that individuals who leave their jobs to follow a military spouse during a transfer are not disqualified from receiving benefits. The bill could potentially cost the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund between $2.1 million and $3.7 million annually, depending on economic conditions and the number of new beneficiaries.",potential hot button issue,"HB 404. By Representatives Yates of the 73rd, Orrock of the 58th, Lakly of the 72nd, Freeman of the 140th, Warren of the 122nd and others: A BILL to be entitled an Act to amend Code Section 34-8-194 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to grounds for disqualification of unemployment benefits, so as to provide that leaving an employer because of the transfer of a spouse from one military assignment to another shall not disqualify a person from such benefits; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes. Senate Sponsor: Senator Douglas of the 17th. The following Fiscal Note, as required by law, was read by the Secretary: DEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS 254 Washington Street, S.W., Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400 Russell W. Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 21, 2005 The Honorable John Yates, Chairman Defense and Veterans Affairs Committee State Capitol, Room 217 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 404 (LC 21 8121) TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2005 1997 Dear Chairman Yates: This bill would amend unemployment benefit insurance provisions to provide that persons leaving an employer to accompany a spouse who has been reassigned from one military assignment to another are not disqualified from receiving benefits by that fact alone. Depending on Georgia’s economy and the related number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries, the fiscal impact of this bill to the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund could approximate from $2.1 million to $3.7 million annually. The assumptions used to calculate these amounts are described below. The Georgia Department of Labor (DOL) does not maintain data on the number of persons who do not qualify for unemployment benefits for the reason cited in this bill. However, DOL obtained information from another state, which indicates the number of persons receiving unemployment insurance benefits there increased by ½ of 1 percent after implementation of similar legislation. Assuming that Georgia would have a similar experience, this percentage increase was applied to the total number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries in Georgia. DOL noted that the state providing unemployment data has only three military bases so the extent to which this percentage would approximate actual experience in Georgia cannot be determined. The low estimate of $2.1 million is based on data from 1999 which, according to DOL, was a non-recession year. In 1999, DOL data shows that there were 199,853 persons in Georgia who received unemployment insurance benefits for an average of 9 weeks. Consequently, if Georgia experiences a similar non-recession year in the future, this bill could increase the number of beneficiaries by 999 (199,853 x 0.5%). Multiplying this potential number of new beneficiaries (999) by the average number of benefit weeks (9) and by the current average weekly benefit of $235 would yield a fiscal impact of approximately $2.1 million. The high estimate of $3.7 million is based on year 2004 DOL data. In 2004, this data shows that there were 265,324 persons in Georgia who received unemployment insurance benefits for an average of 12 weeks. Using these figures, this bill could increase the number of beneficiaries by 1,327 (265,324 x 0.5%). Multiplying the number of new beneficiaries (1,327) by the average number of benefit weeks (12) and the current average weekly benefit of $235 would yield a fiscal impact of approximately $3.7 million. 54 1998 Sincerely, /s/ Russell W.

THURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2005 2393 The Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee offered the following substitute to SR 297: A RESOLUTION Urging the United States Congress to establish a domestic energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of energy and the appropriate infrastructure; and for other purposes. WHEREAS, the price of natural gas in the United States, already the highest in the industrial world, has again spiked and shows continued volatility; and WHEREAS, the current price of natural gas is equivalent to paying $16.00 for a gallon of milk, $12.70 for a pound of ground beef, or $9.21 for a gallon of gasoline; and WHEREAS, abnormally high natural gas prices have been a $111 billion unanticipated burden on the economy of the United States over the past 30 months; and WHEREAS, the United States is over reliant on natural gas in our national energy supply, creating a tremendous imbalance between natural gas supply and demand; and WHEREAS, Georgia's manufacturers, farmers, small businesses, local governments, retailers, and residential consumers are struggling from skyrocketing natural gas prices. Further, thousands of jobs in these industries are threatened since many of these businesses use natural gas as a raw material as well as an energy supply; and WHEREAS, the natural gas imbalance is not a free market problem. The high price of natural gas is created by governmental policies that increase demand for natural gas while impeding the development of a greater supply by discouraging more exploration and production. Since natural gas is domestically produced and very hard to import, the United States cannot correct the imbalance by the importation of natural gas; and WHEREAS, the Georgia Senate supports a sound, rational, and domestic energy policy. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that this body urges the United States Congress to enact legislation in the 109th Congress establishing a domestic energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of natural gas and the appropriate infrastructure. Such energy policy should develop a concerted national effort to promote greater energy efficiency, and open promising new areas for environmentally responsible natural gas production. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed to transmit an appropriate copy of this resolution to President George W. Bush, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of the Georgia congressional delegation. 252 2394 On the adoption of the substitute, the yeas were 30, nays 3, and the committee substitute was adopted.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA: SECTION 1. Chapter 1 of Title 10 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to selling and other trade practices, is amended by adding a new Article 34 to read as follows: ARTICLE 34 10-1-910. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) The privacy and financial security of individuals is increasingly at risk due to the ever more widespread collection of personal information by both the private and public sectors; (2) Credit card transactions, magazine subscriptions, telephone numbers, real estate records, automobile registrations, consumer surveys, warranty registrations, credit reports, and Internet websites are all sources of personal information and form the source material for identity thieves; (3) Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes committed in this state. Criminals who steal personal information such as social security numbers use the information to open credit card accounts, write bad checks, buy cars, and commit other financial crimes with other people´s identities; (4) Identity theft is costly to the marketplace and to consumers; and (5) Victims of identity theft must act quickly to minimize the damage; therefore, expeditious notification of possible misuse of a person´s personal information is imperative. 10-1-911. As used in this article, the term: (1) 'Breach of the security of the system' means unauthorized acquisition of an individual´s file or computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information of such individual maintained by an information broker. Good faith acquisition of personal information by an employee or agent of an information broker for the purposes of such information broker is not a breach of the 424 2738 security of the system, provided that the personal information is not used or subject to further unauthorized disclosure. (2) 'File,' when used in connection with information on any individual, means all of the information on that individual recorded and retained by an information broker regardless of how the information is stored. (3) 'Information broker' means any person or entity who, for monetary fees or dues, engages in whole or in part in the practice of collecting, assembling, evaluating, compiling, reporting, transmitting, transferring, or communicating information concerning individuals for the purposes of furnishing personal information to third parties, but does not include any governmental agency whose records are maintained primarily for traffic safety, law enforcement, or licensing purposes. (4) 'Notice' means: (A) Written notice; (B) Electronic notice, if the notice provided is consistent with the provisions regarding electronic records and signatures set forth in Section 7001 of Title 15 of the United States Code; or (C) Substitute notice, if the information broker demonstrates that the cost of providing notice would exceed $250,000.00, that the affected class of individuals to be notified exceeds 500,000, or that the information broker does not have sufficient contact information to provide written or electronic notice to such individuals. Substitute notice shall consist of all of the following: (i) E-mail notice, if the information broker has an e-mail address for the individuals to be notified; (ii) Conspicuous posting of the notice on the information broker´s website page, if the information broker maintains one; and (iii) Notification to major state-wide media. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, an information broker that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal information and is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this article shall be deemed to be in compliance with the notification requirements of this article if it notifies the individuals who are the subjects of the notice in accordance with its policies in the event of a breach of the security of the system. (5) 'Person' means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust, estate, cooperative, association, or other entity. The term 'person' as used in this article shall not be construed to require duplicative reporting by any individual, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, or other entity involved in the same transaction. (6) 'Personal information' means an individual´s first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted: (A) Social security number; TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2005 2739 (B) Driver´s license number of an individual or number of an individual´s identification card issued pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 5 of Title 40; (C) Account number, credit card number, or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual´s financial account; or (D) Other information collected, assembled, evaluated, compiled, reported, transmitted, transferred, or communicated concerning such individual. The term 'personal information' does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records. 10-1-912. (a) Any information broker that owns or licenses files or computerized data that includes personal information of individuals shall give notice of any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data to any resident of this state whose unencrypted personal information or file was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. The notice shall be made within ten days following such discovery or notification. (b) Any information broker that maintains computerized data that includes personal information of individuals that the information broker does not own shall notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the data immediately following discovery, if the personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. (c) The notification required by this Code section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The notification required by this Code section shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that it will not compromise the investigation. (d) The duty of an information broker to disclose a breach of the security of the system under this Code section shall apply to all such breaches occurring on and after the effective date of this article and any breaches that occurred within six months immediately prior to the effective date of this article. SECTION 2. This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval. SECTION 3. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

Senate Sponsor: Senator Cagle of the 49th. The following Fiscal Note, as required by law, was read by the Secretary: DEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS 254 Washington Street, S.W., Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400 Russell W. Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 23, 2005 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 538 (LC 18 4202) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill would allow members of the National Guard and reservists on active duty for 90 or more consecutive days to exclude all income (earned and unearned) from Georgia income tax. This bill would amend current law, which provides for an exemption of military income from taxation under similar circumstances regarding active duty. The revenue impact therefore is due to the additional exclusion of non-military income for those qualifying for the exemption. The bill also provides for a no-cost extension of state licensure and registration requirements for guard and reserve members other than attorneys who meet the 90-day duty criteria 711 3312 The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center estimates the upper bound revenue impact of this change to be a revenue loss of approximately $9.7 million. The Center provided the following narrative regarding this estimate: The revenue loss associated with this bill comes from four sources: unearned income (interest, dividends, etc.), wages from non-military employment in the same calendar year in which deployment took place, wages from non-military employers that are given by the previous employer to hold harmless those deployed, and the reduced revenue from license and registration renewals. In 2003, it was reported that 7,700 reservists and National Guard troops from Georgia were on active duty (compared to a nationwide total of 204,000). For 2005, it is assumed that the number of active duty reservists and National Guard troops remains approximately the same and that these individuals meet the 90-day rule of this legislation. The Department of Defense publishes data on the number of reservists and Guard troops on active duty but does not publish the date of deployment. An upper bound revenue cost estimate is made assuming that 9 months of regular salary is covered under the income exclusion of this bill. The 2000 U.S. Census Bureau’s 5% sample of individuals is used to determine the average unearned income of individuals on active duty (data are not available specifically for reservists and national guard troops on active duty) and for those who report that they are training for reserves or National Guard duty. The income data reported in the 2000 Census is based on 1999 actual income. For those reporting active duty, average wages for Georgians are $24,377 per year and other income above wages is $1,000 on average. This suggests that for career military, total income is only slightly larger than their military pay. In the same data sample the average total income of individuals who report that they are training for reserves or National Guard is $33,108 and wage income is $28,029. The average payment to a National Guard or reservist in Georgia in 1999 was $6,200 (based on deflating 2003 data). This income should be reported as “other income” and therefore included in total income but not in wage income as reported to the Census. These data demonstrate that, on average, a member of the reserves or National Guard reports wages and very little “other income” aside from reserve pay. Based on data from the Department of Defense, the average pay for Georgians on active duty is $40,800 per year (fiscal year 2003) and $43,500 at 2005 levels. Under current Georgia law (Code Section 48-7-27), this income is exempt from state income tax and data suggest that no hold harmless supplement would be given by non-military employers to these individuals. Therefore, the only anticipated revenue loss for these individuals is the non-military pay they received in a calendar year once they meet the 90-day rule. As noted above, assuming that THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2005 3313 this pertains to 9 months of salary, this results in a revenue loss of $4.2 million for this group of guard and reservists (66 percent of the total number of troops). For individuals with above average wages and total income (about 33 percent of the reservist and guard troops), the average difference between wages and total income is also approximately equal to the average reservists pay in 1999, suggesting that there is little other non-military income. However, for these individuals at 2005 levels, active duty military pay is $20,480 less than their average wage. Conservatively assuming that 10 percent of that difference would be made up as supplements from employers and that all active duty reservist and guard troops report $1,000 in non-military income, the revenue cost associated with hold harmless payment from their employers is estimated to be $460,000 for 2005 at an average tax rate of 5.0 percent (developed using the Georgia Income Tax Microsimulation model) and the additional 9 months salary exemption is estimated to cost $4.9 million in revenue loss (assuming an annual average wage of $63,980 for this group of 33 percent of the total troops). A lower bound estimate assuming 3 months of non-military pay exemption yields a revenue loss of $3.5 million. The Secretary of State lists 43 occupations for which Georgia has various registration and licensing requirements. The value of the renewals and costs for late renewal vary widely, with an unweighted average of $150. Using the Census data used above, it is estimated that approximately 10 percent of the reservists are in occupations for which licensing and registration fees would apply. Using these data, the revenue cost associated with this component of the bill is $120,000. Sincerely, /s/ Russell W. Hinton State Auditor /s/ Timothy A.

The following Fiscal Note, as required by law, was read by the Secretary: DEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS 254 Washington Street, S.W., Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400 Russell W. Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 17, 2005 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 211 (LC 18 4021) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill would exempt from ad valorem taxation aircraft that are for sale and held in inventory by aircraft dealers. The exemption would be effective for all tax years beginning after January 1, 2006. The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center determined that the estimated revenue loss to the state is very small (under $20,000) for FY 2007 and FY 2008. Most of the revenue loss will be borne by local governments and is estimated to be approximately $2 million for FY 2007 and FY 2008. The data used comes from the current sales inventories gathered from the websites of Georgia-based aircraft dealers. In most cases, asking prices were obtained from these online advertisements. Where asking prices were not available, they were estimated using the price of identical models of similar age for sale in other states. Where comparable models were not available, the average price of current Georgia inventories was used. Asking prices range from $33,500 to $19,995,000. It was estimated that there is currently $178 million in aircraft inventories in the state of Georgia. Note that it is common practice to fly aircraft out state at the time inventory would be valued for property tax purposes. Assuming that 40 percent of the asking price is the assessed value, and using 49 1988 an average property tax rate of 28 mills, the resulting revenue is estimated to be $2.0 million in FY 2007. We expect the loss would be the same in FY 2008. Since the state’s property tax rate is only 0.25 mills, the revenue loss to the state would be less than one percent of the total revenue loss.

Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 February 24, 2005 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Revised Fiscal Note House Bill 306 (LC 18 4096) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill would exempt from state use tax purchases of tangible personal property by a government or bona fide department thereof which is furnished to a contractor for incorporation into a construction, renovation or repair project pursuant to a contract with the government or department. The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center estimated the revenue impact for this proposed legislation as an annual decrease in state tax revenue of $127 million. Local sales taxes would be reduced by approximately $95 million per year. The combined impact on state and local revenues would be approximately $222 million. The Center provided the following narrative regarding these estimates: TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2005 2051 Potentially, this legislation could exempt from use tax all purchases of materials, supplies and other tangible items that are used in government funded construction projects. The U.S. Census Bureau survey of state and local government finance lists contract expenditures for fiscal year 2001 of $4,315 million for Georgia local governments and $2,387 million for Georgia state government. In addition, U.S. federal contract expenditures totaled $84,760 million. Assuming that Georgia’s share of this federal activity is equal to Georgia’s share of total U.S. personal income of 2.78%, this equates to an additional $2,357 million in contract expenditures. Adding these three categories together yields an estimate of total government contract expenditures of approximately $9.1 billion per year. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the cost of materials, components, supplies and fuels to represent 32.7% per dollar of construction work for Heavy Construction Contractors and to represent 37.1% per dollar of construction work for Highway & Street contractors. An estimate of 35% was used to calculate the dollar value of tangible property based on the $9.1 billion in total contract expenditures. This equals just under $3.2 billion in expenditures on tangible property that could be exempt under the proposed legislation. Applying the state sales and use tax rate of 4% to this estimate yields the estimate of a decrease in state revenues of approximately $127 million per year. Applying a local sales tax rate of 3% yields an estimate of approximately $95 million in reduced local tax revenue per year. Sincerely, /s/ Russell W. Hinton State Auditor /s/ Timothy A.

Hinton State Auditor (404) 656-2174 Honorable Larry O’Neal, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee State Capitol, Room 133 Atlanta, Georgia 30334 SUBJECT: Fiscal Note House Bill 431 (LC 22 5776ER) Dear Chairman O’Neal: This bill would amend the Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act so as to allow Electric Membership Corporations to dispose of dividends or capital credits which are presumed abandoned. Currently, these dividends or capital credits are remitted to the Commissioner of Revenue. The Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center estimates that the impact of this proposed legislation is to reduce revenue to the state under the Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act by $900,000 to $1,900,000 per year. The Georgia Electric Membership Corporation (GEMC) is the trade group representing the 42 electric membership cooperatives in the state of Georgia. In 2002, GEMC surveyed its members regarding levels of capital credits over the five-year period 1997 – 2001. It found annual abandoned capital credits ranged from a low of $900,000 to a high of $1,900,000 summed across its members. The revenue estimate assumes that these historical levels will continue into the future. Sincerely, /s/ Russell W. Hinton State Auditor /s/ Timothy A.
